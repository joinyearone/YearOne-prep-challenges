  body: |
    <strong>Algorithm focused on string manipulation!</strong><br>
    Find the integer value of a given roman string. <br>
    Roman numerals are represented by symbols I, V, X, L, C, D and M.<br>
    Roman numerals are written largest to smallest from left to right.<br>
    However, 4 is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.<br>
    Same principle applies to the number 9, which is written as IX. <br>
    There are six instances where subtraction is used:<br>

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. <br>
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. <br>
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. <br>

      Problem 2 of Project Euler
    </strong>
    <br>
      Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated
      by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1
      and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    </br>
    <br>
      1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    </br>
    <br>
      By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
      whose values do not exceed four million (4000000),
      find the sum of the even-valued terms.
